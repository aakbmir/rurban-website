          Our focus is to reduce and potentially eliminate the substantial
          contrast in health-care services that exists between rural and
          urban-based healthcare. We adopt and strive to create a multi-faceted
          approach to this issue, and hope for an impact that establishes
          equality in healthcare for all.
